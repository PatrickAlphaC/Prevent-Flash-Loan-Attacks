## How to report a bug

Think you found a bug? Please check [the list of open issues](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/Prevent-Flash-Loan-Attacks/issues) to see if your bug has already been reported. If it hasn't please [submit a new issue](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/Prevent-Flash-Loan-Attacks/issues/new).

Here are a few tips for writing *great* bug reports:

* Describe the specific problem (e.g., "widget doesn't turn clockwise" versus "getting an error")
* Include the steps to reproduce the bug, what you expected to happen, and what happened instead
* Check that you are using the latest version of the project and its dependencies
* Include what version of the project your using, as well as any relevant dependencies
* Only include one bug per issue. If you have discovered two bugs, please file two issues
* Even if you don't know how to fix the bug, including a failing test may help others track it down

## Your first contribution

We'd love for you to contribute to the project, this is how we will bring the most light to how to prevent more projects from falling victim to all these flash loan attacks. We've already seen HUGE issues so far!

*p.s. Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first* :smiley_cat:

## How to propose changes 

*Base content from [Cayman theme Github](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman)*

Here's a few general guidelines for proposing changes:

* If you are making visual changes, include a screenshot of what the affected element looks like, both before and after.
* Follow the [Jekyll style guide](https://ben.balter.com/jekyll-style-guide).
* If you are changing any user-facing functionality, please be sure to update the documentation
* Each pull request should implement **one** feature or bug fix. If you want to add or fix more than one thing, submit more than one pull request
* Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bug fix
* Don't bump the version number in your pull request (it will be bumped prior to release)
* Write [a good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)

At a high level, [the process for proposing changes](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) is:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/Prevent-Flash-Loan-Attacks/fork) and clone the project
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
3. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/Prevent-Flash-Loan-Attacks/compare)
4. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged
