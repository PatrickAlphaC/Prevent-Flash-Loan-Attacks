# Abstract

This site is dedicated to information about flash loan attacks (which are usually just price oracle attacks) and how to stop them. For a study done by the Imperial College London, check out this deep dive on the historic bZx flash loan (oracle manipulation) attack for more information. The first step you can take, is to use decentralized oracles when working with data, a number of the projects that had issues moved themselves to <a title="Chainlink" href="https://chain.link">Chainlink</a> Price Feeds and are now secure. This is an open source project.
