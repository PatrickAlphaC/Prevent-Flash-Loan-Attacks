# Types of attacks

## Oracle Manipulation

This seems to be the #1 cause of attacks at the moment, by far. What is important to note, is that decentralized exchanges are not decentralized oracles. Using Uniswap, Sushiswap, or Curve to get pricing information to execute trades is pulling data from potocols whose price depends soley on liquidity. Looking at the infamous ground zero bZx attack that sparked this wave of attacks, we can see exactly what happens. These flash loans are used to crash and manipulate the price of these decentralized exchanges, which most projects deemed safe to use. The issue here relies in the fact that these protocols prices depend entirely on liquidity.

See the above section for what something like this would look like.

### Prevention

The easiest way to solve this is to use [decentralized oracles](https://blog.chain.link/flash-loans-and-the-importance-of-tamper-proof-oracles/). [Chainlink Price Feeds](https://feeds.chain.link/) are the leading decentralized oracle provider, and you can see that the vast majority of the protocols end up adding Chainlink to fix these attacks. If the data (price or otherwise) you're looking for isn't there yet, you can always request new decentralized networks or [build your own](https://docs.chain.link/docs/make-a-http-get-request).

### Prevention Example

Let's take a look at some malicious pseudo-code, pretend these are each ERC20s.

```javascript
uint256 priceOfMyGovernanceTokenInETH = dexTokenETHPairPrice;
myGovernanceToken.transfer(msg.sender, priceOfMyGovernanceTokenInETH)
```

This right here should be the easiest red flag on the planet. If you ever do a transfer based on a centralized price oracle, you're asking to get owned. One way or another.

Check the [Chainlink documentation for decentralized price feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-the-latest-price)

```javascript
import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.6/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";
// constructor and getLatestPrice function truncated
uint256 priceOfMyGovernanceTokenInETH = getLatestChainlinkPrice();
myGovernanceToken.transfer(msg.sender, priceOfMyGovernanceTokenInETH)
```

## Reentrancy

A reentrancy attack can occur when you create a function that makes an external call to another untrusted contract before it resolves any effects. If the attacker can control the untrusted contract, they can make a recursive call back to the original function, repeating interactions that would have otherwise not run after the effects were resolved.

### Prevention

Leave external transactions to the last parameter. These are the harder ones to prevent, but below is a simple example of what should be done.

### Prevention Example

This code:

```javascript
function withdraw() external {
    uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
    require(token.transfer(msg.sender, amount)());
    balances[msg.sender] = 0;
}
```

Should be changed so that the external token transfer call happens **after** the balance is updated to 0.

```javascript
function withdraw() external {
    uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
    balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    require(token.transfer(msg.sender, amount)());
}
```

## Pump and Arbitrage

### Prevention

## Safe Integer use and basic audits

Everything that applies to basic contract safety applies to flash loan attack safety. Such as:

```
using SafeMath for uint256;
```

Watch out for integer overflows, etc.
