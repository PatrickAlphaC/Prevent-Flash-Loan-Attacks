# Contributing

Thank you for taking time and care into improving Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and the Prevent Flash Loan Attacks initiative. Here is how you can help make DeFi more secure.

# Create an issue

You can start by creating an issue to propose changes, improve sections or anything you seem necessary. We welcome anything no matter how small it is, provided it falls under the umbrella of the Prevent Flash Loan Attacks [mission](README.md#Mission).

# Add a change

You can also add a change by cloning this repository and develop it locally. Please see the [Build](README.md#Build) section for instructions on how to get started.

# Add an attack

## Clone

To report an attack, start by following the [Build](README.md#Build) instruction to get the site up and running on your local machine.

## Create a new branch

In the project's directory, create a new branch by running

```
$ git branch -b <branch-name>
```

We recommend naming the new branch `dev` for simplicity.

To add an attack, edit [`src/pages/historic-attacks.mdx`](src/pages/historic-attacks.mdx). We use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to manage site's content. If in doubt, you can create an issue.
